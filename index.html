I enjoy music a lot but I tend to be band oriented thus becoming a self-proclaimed band geek.<br>

my talents and especially tells me my hidden talents so that I can do my best for raising your compant in 
high level.<br>

<section class="about">
<p class="s2">
I'm a good listener. I like to help other people, though sometimes it kind of overtakes my own problems. <br>
I'll admit right now that I work on other people's problems to get away from my own. I've been told I'm good with advice, <br>I just never seem to be able to help myself.
My MAIN AIM is to help my customers and treat everyone as a nice person.
